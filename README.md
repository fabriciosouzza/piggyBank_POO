# Cofrinho Project

* This code is just an application of the OOP concepts, as polymorphism and encapsulation.

* For execute it, you just have to open the files in a IDE or a text editor like VSCode, with a debbuger system. 

* For future adjustments, I really like to apply the SOLID concepts for a more scalable application
